   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An authentic Mexican salsa made with tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos. Serve with <br>
        tacos, nachos, tortilla chips, black beans, refried beans, or fajitas or use as an <br>
        ingredient in many Mexican recipes. My family uses it as a side in which to dip grilled <br>
        steak. If you like it hot, then this is for you; this pico is not for the faint of heart. <br>
        It is very hot, which most people in my circle like. If you don't like highly spicy dishes, <br>
        you might might want to try something less spicy or cut down the jalapeno and use a type <br>
        pepper that is more to your taste.An authentic Mexican salsa made with tomatoes, onions, and <br>
